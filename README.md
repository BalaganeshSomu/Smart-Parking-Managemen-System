# **Smart-Parking-Managemen-System**

Parking and space management are some of the major issues faced by all the developing
countries across the globe. Catering this problem our “Smart Parking Management System”
will help the busy commuters to block a parking spot or drive-in directly with minimal interaction
and waiting time.
To balance the cost and service quality, we propose to monitor the parking lot through an
efficient system. An app will be developed to help the commuters to book parking in advance.
Specifically we deploy the use of two cameras to capture license plate numbers and their
vehicle type by tracking the vehicles when they enter or leave the parking lot. The main
advantage of this project is this doesn’t make it mandatory for the commuters to have the app
and thereby entertaining on-spot parking also.
Our system can automatically detect when a car enters the parking space, the location of the
parking spot, and precisely charge the parking fee and associate this with the license plate
number. Through the intelligent algorithm, we can significantly reduce the cost of existing
systems, while achieving a more adaptable solution.
